# elpAudio NSIS Installer
**To make elpAudio installing a bit better and simpler, elpAudio-nsis was created.**

For compiling you need:
 - 7z.exe (from 7-zip folder)
 - elpAudio(-nochromakey).zip (elpAudio archive which will be extracted to some folder)
 - NSIS compiler
 - Microsoft Visual C 2010 x86 redistruable (i don't know how to spell that correctly)
